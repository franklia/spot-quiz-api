    "question" : "What does a Javascript bundler (like Webpack) do?",
    "answer" : "A bundler is a tool that puts your code and all its dependencies together in one JavaScript file.\nBundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.\nBundling lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time."
